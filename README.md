# Assignment on Error recovery:

Create distributed systems with socket programming. Create multiple- client and server environment.
Create a log-file for each client, server maintains them. The log-file of respective client contains all the requests made by it along with Bme stamps and the status of request processing (Y/N). A client can make mulBple requests to server (you can refer previous assignments). Client can ask itâ€™s log file as one of the requests. But the client has to send the log file back after reading it.

## Among all the processes there is a daemon process, which tries to corrupt log file. The server should be capable of tracing this informaBon. ANer the request is processed the server can check immediately or at regular intervals of Bme for the following things and correct them,
1. If the client corrupts the log file, the server should name the client as daemon and noBfy other clients.
2. The system has to recover from this.
3. Use any error recovery approaches to go back to the previous points. (Maintain a log for this)
4. Daemon process should be blocked.
